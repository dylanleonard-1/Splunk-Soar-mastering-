## **Comprehensive Labs Portfolio**  

Welcome to my **Splunk SOAR Mastery** repository! This project is dedicated to showcasing my ability to automate security operations, build dynamic playbooks, and handle real-world cybersecurity incidents using Splunk SOAR.  

Here, you will find a series of hands-on labs that I’ve built from the ground up — demonstrating everything from beginner-level configuration to advanced SOAR automation and custom app development.
